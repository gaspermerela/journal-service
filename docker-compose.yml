# Production Docker Compose Configuration
#
# Purpose: Deploy app container to server with PostgreSQL running on host (via systemctl)
# Use this for: Production deployment where database is managed separately
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - PostgreSQL running on host (systemctl)
#   - Database user and schema configured
#
# Deploy: See docker/deploy.sh and docker/run.sh scripts
# Note: Uses host network mode to access localhost PostgreSQL

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: journal-service
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Load environment variables from .env file
    env_file:

    # Run migrations then start app

      - ${CACHE_PATH_HOST:-./data/cache}:/app/data/cache  # Spell-check pickle cache (persists across restarts)

    # Logging configuration
